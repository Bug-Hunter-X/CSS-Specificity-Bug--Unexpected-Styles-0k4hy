One solution is to be more explicit and add a more specific selector to override the unintended style. Another, and generally less preferable due to potential conflicts, would be to use the `!important` flag, but only as a last resort.

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special {
  color: red;
}

#unique {
  color: green;
}

#unique.special {
  color: purple;
}

/* Solution: Add a more specific selector */
#unique.special {
  color: orange !important; /* Less desirable solution, use sparingly */
}

/* Or: 
#unique.special {
  color: orange; 
}
This will likely work but could clash with more styles than the first solution. */
```
This ensures that the intended style is applied correctly.
